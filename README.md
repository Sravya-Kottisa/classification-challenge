# Classification-challenge

## Objective:
* Train and evaluate two machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier) on a dataset
* Compare the performance of the two models
* Predict which model will perform better and explain why

## Dataset:
 https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv

## Task:
* Load and preprocess the dataset
* Split the data into training and testing sets
* Train a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest Classifier model on the training data
* Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing data
* Compare the accuracy scores of the two models
* Write a brief report explaining the results and predicting which model will perform better

## Instructions:
* Run the code to train and evaluate the models
* Compare the accuracy scores of the two models
